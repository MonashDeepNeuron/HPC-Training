## Git. What is it?

Git is a Source Control Management tool (SCM). It keeps a history of multiple files and directories in a bundle called a repository. Git tracks changes using save points called commits. Commits use `.diff` files to track the difference in files between commits. Repositories can have multiple branches allow many different developers to create new changes and fixes to a codebase that are separate from each other. You can also switch between branches to work on many different changes at once. These branches can then later be merged back together to a `main` branch, integrating the various changes.

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a remote Git service. This allows you to store Git repositories online so that individuals and teams can access and work on Git repositories and projects remotely. It offers many features on top of basic version control such as branch, issue and feature tracking, releases, CI/CD pipelines, project management and more. Its predominately used through its website which offers control of these features through a simple GUI. Throughout your time at Monash DeepNeuron, university and probably for the rest of your career (if in a software based role), you will use service like GitHub to help management the development of projects.

Your first task is to sign up for a GitHub account, if you haven't already. I would highly recommend using a personal email address (not a university one) as you will most likely want access to your account after university.

It is also a good idea to install the GitHub mobile app. This allows you track and manage projects and reply to messages and issues from your phone.

## Joining Monash DeepNeuron's GitHub Organisation

Once you have signed up for GitHub, you will need to provide your instructors with your GitHub username. This is so we can invite you as a member of the Monash DeepNeuron's organisation on GitHub. This will give you access to projects and allow you to communicate with other members. This will also allow you to gain specific privileges for your future projects at Monash DeepNeuron.

## Watching Repositories

GitHub allows you 'watch' repositories. This means you'll be notified of changes to the repository so that you can keep on top of is happening with various projects. You'll be using this later in your training.
