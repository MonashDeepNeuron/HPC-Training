# Nectar Cloud

The ARDC Nectar Research Cloud (Nectar) is Australiaâ€™s national research cloud, specifically designed for research computing. Like with M3, we will set you up with access now before you learn about it in later chapters. [This webpage](https://ardc.edu.au/services/ardc-nectar-research-cloud/) explains what it is if you're curious.

## Cloud Starter Series

ARDC has provided [this cloud starter tutorial series](https://tutorials.rc.nectar.org.au/cloud-starter/01-overview) for people new to Nectar Cloud. You should be able to follow these tutorials using your trial project. If you need more SUs (service units aka. cloud credits) in order to provision more cloud resources for MDN-related work, you should message your HPC Lead with that request.
