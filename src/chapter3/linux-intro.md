# Introduction to Linux

Linux is one of the most popular versions of the UNIX operating System. It is open source as its source code is freely available. It is free to use. Linux was designed considering UNIX compatibility. Its functionality list is quite similar to that of UNIX.

Linux Operating System has primarily three components:
- **Kernel:** The kernel is the core part of Linux. It is responsible for all major activities of this operating system. It consists of various modules and it interacts directly with the underlying hardware. Kernel provides the required abstraction to hide low level hardware details to system or application programs.
- **System Library:** System libraries are special functions or programs using which application programs or system utilities access Kernel’s features. These libraries implement most of the functionalities of the operating system and do not require kernel module’s code access rights.
- **System Utility:** System Utility programs are responsible to do specialised, individual level tasks.
