# Apache Spark

Apache Spark is an open-source, distributed computing system that has gained immense popularity for its speed, ease of use, and versatility in handling large-scale data processing tasks. Developed to overcome the limitations of the MapReduce paradigm, Spark offers a unified platform for various data processing workloads, including batch processing, real-time data streaming, machine learning, and graph processing.

Spark provides high-level APIs in languages like Scala, Java, Python, and R, making it accessible to a wide range of developers with different programming backgrounds.

In this chapter, we will:
- Set up a mini Spark cluster in M3. 
- Take a closer look at the internal data structure, specifically Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs). 
- Explore data processing in PySpark (PySpark and SQL) and JupyterLab.
- Engage in some challenges.
