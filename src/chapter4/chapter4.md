# More C

This chapter will walk you through the more intermediate features of the C language. It aims to build on the theoretical knowledge of operating systems you gained in the last chapter with the practical skills to actually use it. You will learn about other C language constructs, memory allocation, system calls (the Kernel's API) and actually spawning processes & threads.
