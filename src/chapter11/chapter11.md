# Being a HPC Member

Congratulations! You've completed all your technical new recruit training! 

At this point it's important to remember that technical skills are only a part of what's required to succeed as a HPC member. 
Without good teamwork skills and collaboration practices we will not be able to work together effectively and achieve our goals. To that end, this chapter outlines some basic expectations required of all HPC members along with other non-technical information that you might find useful.
