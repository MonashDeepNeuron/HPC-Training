# Logging In

First you will need to ssh into a login node in the cluster. You do this by doing the following:

## Windows

If you are using windows, the best way to ssh into m3 is by using [puTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html).

Once installed and opened, you will see a page like this:

![puTTY config page](./imgs/putty_start.png)

Type in your m3 username followed by `@m3.massive.org.au` and press enter or the Open button.

If it the first time accessing M3 from this client then you may see something like this:

![puTTY auth page](./imgs/putty_key_not_cached.png)

Just click Accept, and puTTY will add the cluster's ssh fingerprint to cache.

## Mac / Linux

On macOS or linux, ssh is built into the terminal, so just copy the following into your shell, substituting username for your username.

```bash
ssh username@m3.massive.org.au
```

You may get a similar warning to the above image about the server identity, just type `yes` or `Y` to accept it and add the ssh key to cache.

> **Note**:
> It is possible to use VSCode's built in terminal to ssh into M3, but it is not recommended. It puts unnecessary strain on the login nodes. M3 have a [guide](https://docs.massive.org.au/M3/connecting/strudel2/connecting-to-vscode.html) on how to correctly connect to M3 using VSCode, however it is quite involved and not particularly necessary unless you want to do proper development on M3 and want to use VSCode to program in.

Everything from now on will be the same across whatever computer you are using to access the cluster.

The first thing to pop up will be a request for a password. Don't worry when you don't see your cursor moving when typing, this is just for security. Your password is still being recorded.

Once you have logged in, you will come to a page that looks like this:
