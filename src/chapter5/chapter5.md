# M3

[M3](https://docs.massive.org.au/M3/index.html) is part of [MASSIVE](https://https://www.massive.org.au/), which is a High Performance Computing facility for Australian scientists and researchers. Monash University is a partner of MASSIVE, and provides as majority of the funding for it. M3 is made up of multiple different types of servers, with a total of 5673 cores, 63.2TB of RAM, 5.6PB of storage, and 1.7 million CUDA cores.

M3 utilises the [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/) workload manager, which is a job scheduler that allows users to submit jobs to the cluster. We will learn a bit more about this later on.

This book will take you through the basics of connecting to M3, submitting jobs, transferring data to and from the system and some other things. If you want to learn more about M3, you can read the [M3 documentation](https://docs.massive.org.au/M3/index.html). This will give you a more in-depth look at the system, and how to use it.
