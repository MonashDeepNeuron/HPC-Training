# Parallel Computing

In this chapter, we will discuss the abstraction of parallel computing. To facilitate our exploration, we will employ a API within the C Programming Language: OpenMP. This tool will serve as a means to concretely illustrate the underlying language-independent theory.

**Parallel computing is about executing the instructions of the program simultaneously.**

One of the core values of computing is the breaking down of a big problem into smaller easier to solve problems, or at least smaller problems. In some cases, the steps required to solve the problem can be executed simultaneously (in parallel) rather than sequentially (in order).
